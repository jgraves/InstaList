ðŸŽ§ Instalist

Instalist is a personal iOS project aimed at making Spotify playlist creation faster, smarter, and more delightful.

This app is a playground for exploring modern iOS development, authentication flows, Spotifyâ€™s Web API, and best practices around app architecture â€” all while building something genuinely useful for music lovers.

ðŸš§ Disclaimer

This is a learning project, not a production-ready app. Itâ€™s my way of staying sharp with Swift, SwiftUI, and the ever-evolving Apple platform ecosystem. Expect rough edges, TODOs, and the occasional rabbit hole.

ðŸ§  What Iâ€™m Exploring
	â€¢	SwiftUI app structure and lifecycle
	â€¢	OAuth2 authentication (with Spotify)
  * Spotify API best practccies
	â€¢	Modular architecture with MVVM
	â€¢	Async/await and concurrency
	â€¢	Clean code practices without over-engineering

ðŸ’¡ Why Iâ€™m Building This

Iâ€™ve always found the official Spotify app great for listening â€” but not for organizing or generating playlists. Instalist is a tool I wish existed: something to help me generate and manage playlists based on recent listens, moods, or vibes, without all the taps and swipes.

Itâ€™s also a chance to:
	â€¢	Re-learn iOS development after time in engineering leadership
	â€¢	Reconnect with product thinking and hands-on coding
	â€¢	Share what Iâ€™m learning along the way
